This is a convenience patch bundle.
If 'git apply' fails due to context mismatches, copy the two files into your project:

- src/tutorial.css
- src/circular-button.css

These files contain:
- Particles behind tasks (z-index stack cleaned; panel positioned)
- Play button 2× and stable (offset via CSS vars; wrapper scales from center)
